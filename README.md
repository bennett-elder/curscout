# curscout

802.11 Probe Request scout built with python/scapy/curses back in 2011 sometime. Saw some shortcomings in what aircrack-ng tools would do so I rolled my own. 

A great deal of credit for the inspiration for this project should go to Vivek Ramachandran and his videos on securitytube.net. That was back before the site did certifications or any of that. It was just a security researcher with his videos on a site.
